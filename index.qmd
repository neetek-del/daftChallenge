# üé® DAFT Package Challenge - Recreating the Scurvy DAGs

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Challenge Requirements In Section [Student Analysis Section](#student-analysis-section)
- Recreate all three scurvy DAGs using DAFT programming
- Optional: Demonstrate understanding of DAFT customization options

## The Problem: Mastering Probabilistic Graphical Models with DAFT

**Core Question:** How can we use the DAFT package to create visually appealing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that tell a compelling data story?

**The Challenge:** You'll recreate three historical DAGs depicting the fascinating story of how we lost and rediscovered the cure to scurvy. This challenge teaches you to use DAFT for creating professional-quality probabilistic graphical models.

**Our Approach:** We'll work through the three different understandings of the scurvy data generating process, learning DAFT customization techniques while exploring a crucial moment in medical history.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Scurvy Story: A Data Science Tragedy

Scurvy was a devastating disease that affected sailors on long voyages. The cure was discovered in 1747, but due to a misunderstanding about the cause, the cure was lost for over 150 years. The story involves three different understandings of the data generating process:

1. **1747 Understanding:** Lemons prevent scurvy (correct but incomplete!)
2. **Misguided Belief:** Acid kills bacteria that causes scurvy (wrong!)
3. **1928 Understanding:** Vitamin C prevents scurvy (the real mechanism)

## Environment Setup

First, let's install the DAFT package and set up our environment:

```{python}
#| label: setup-environment
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Install DAFT package (run this in terminal if not already installed)
# pip install 'daft-pgm'

import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Set up plotting parameters for better quality
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 150
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300

print("DAFT package imported successfully!")
print("Ready to create beautiful DAGs!")
```

## üí° Understanding DAFT

**DAFT (Directed Acyclic Factor Graphs Toolkit)** is a Python package for creating probabilistic graphical models. It's particularly useful for:

- Creating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Visualizing causal relationships
- Communicating data generating processes
- Creating publication-quality figures

**Key DAFT Concepts:**

- **Nodes:** Represent variables or factors
- **Edges:** Show relationships between variables
- **Plates:** Indicate repeated structures
- **Styling:** Customize colors, shapes, and formatting

## The Three DAGs: Your Mission

Your task is to recreate these three historical DAGs using DAFT, making them visually appealing and professionally formatted.

### DAG 1: The 1747 Understanding (Correct but Incomplete)

**Historical Context:** In 1747, James Lind discovered that lemons prevent scurvy through a controlled experiment. However, the understanding was incomplete - they knew lemons worked but not why.

**Your Task:** Recreate this DAG showing the relationship between lemons and scurvy prevention.

**Reference Image:**

```{python}
#| label: dag-1-1747
#| echo: true

# TODO: Replace this placeholder with your DAFT code
# Create a DAG showing the 1747 understanding: Lemons ‚Üí Scurvy Prevention

# Your code here - recreate the DAG from the reference image
# Use DAFT to create nodes and edges that match the visual structure
# Customize colors and styling to make it professional


# Create the PGM (Probabilistic Graphical Model)
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, aspect=1.6)

# Add nodes for Lemons and Scurvy Prevention
pgm.add_node("lemons", "Lemons / Citrus Intake", 0, 0, aspect=3, scale=1.2,
             plot_params={'facecolor':'#ffe066', 'edgecolor':'orange', 'linewidth':1.5})
pgm.add_node("scurvy", "Scurvy Prevention", 3, 0, aspect=3, scale=1.2,
             plot_params={'facecolor':'#b3ffb3', 'edgecolor':'green', 'linewidth':1.5})

# Add directional edge showing the causal link
pgm.add_edge("lemons", "scurvy")

# Render and display
pgm.render()
plt.title("DAG 1: 1747 Understanding ‚Äî Lemons prevent Scurvy", fontsize=12)
plt.show()





```

### DAG 2: The Misguided Belief (Wrong Understanding)

**Historical Context:** Over time, people came to believe it was the acid in lemons that killed bacteria which was causing scurvy. This led to lemons being replaced by limes (cheaper but less Vitamin C) or just using acids like vinegar, causing scurvy to return.

**Your Task:** Recreate this DAG showing the incorrect understanding of the data generating process.

```{python}
#| label: dag-2-misguided
#| echo: true

# TODO: Replace this placeholder with your DAFT code
# Create a DAG showing the misguided belief: Acid ‚Üí Bacteria Death ‚Üí Scurvy Prevention

# Your code here - recreate the DAG from the reference image
# This DAG should show the incorrect causal chain
# Use different colors or styling to indicate this is the wrong understanding
import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the PGM (Probabilistic Graphical Model)
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, aspect=1.8)

# Add nodes for Acid, Bacteria Death, and Scurvy Prevention
pgm.add_node(
    "acid",
    "Acid (from Lemons)",
    0, 0,  # bottom-left
    aspect=3.5,  # fixed missing aspect
    scale=1.1,
    plot_params={
        'facecolor': '#fff44f',  # Lemon yellow
        'edgecolor': '#e6e600',  # Darker yellow
        'linewidth': 1.5
    }
)

pgm.add_node(
    "bacteria",
    "Bacteria Death",
    2, 1,  # slanted upwards for visual flow
    aspect=3,
    scale=1.1,
    plot_params={
        'facecolor': '#ffebcc',  # Soft orange/tan
        'edgecolor': '#cc6600',  # Darker orange/brown
        'linewidth': 1.5
    }
)

pgm.add_node(
    "scurvy",
    "Scurvy Prevention",
    4, 2,  # top-right for slanted line
    aspect=3,
    scale=1.1,
    plot_params={
        'facecolor': '#b3ffb3',  # Soft green
        'edgecolor': 'green',
        'linewidth': 1.5
    }
)

# Add edges for the causal chain
pgm.add_edge("acid", "bacteria")
pgm.add_edge("bacteria", "scurvy")

# Render and display
pgm.render()
plt.title("DAG 2: Misguided Belief ‚Äî Acid kills Bacteria ‚Üí prevents Scurvy (Slanted Line)", fontsize=12)
plt.show()




```

### DAG 3: The 1928 Understanding (Complete and Correct)

**Historical Context:** In 1928, the true mechanism was discovered - it was Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that prevented scurvy. This complete understanding finally explained why lemons worked and why the acid theory was wrong.

**Your Task:** Recreate this DAG showing the complete and correct understanding of the scurvy data generating process.

**Reference Image:**
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyaflya/persuasive/main/images/scurvy3.png)

```{python}
#| label: dag-3-1928
#| echo: true

# TODO: Replace this placeholder with your DAFT code
# Create a DAG showing the 1928 understanding: Vitamin C ‚Üí Scurvy Prevention

# Your code here - recreate the DAG from the reference image
# This should be the most complete and accurate representation
# Use professional styling that would be suitable for a scientific publication

#| label: dag-3-1928
#| echo: true

# Create a DAG showing the 1928 understanding: Vitamin C ‚Üí Scurvy Prevention
import daft
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the PGM (Probabilistic Graphical Model)
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, aspect=0.8)  # Taller figure for vertical layout

# Add nodes for Vitamin C and Scurvy Prevention in a vertical line (top ‚Üí bottom)
pgm.add_node(
    "vitamin_c",
    "Vitamin C Intake",
    0, 3,  # top
    aspect=3,
    scale=1.2,
    plot_params={
        'facecolor': '#ccffcc',  # Soft green
        'edgecolor': 'darkgreen',
        'linewidth': 2
    }
)

pgm.add_node(
    "scurvy",
    "Scurvy Prevention",
    0, 0,  # bottom
    aspect=3,
    scale=1.2,
    plot_params={
        'facecolor': '#b3e6ff',  # Soft blue
        'edgecolor': 'navy',
        'linewidth': 2
    }
)

# Add edge showing the causal link (top ‚Üí bottom)
pgm.add_edge("vitamin_c", "scurvy")

# Render and display
pgm.render()
plt.title("DAG 3: 1928 Understanding ‚Äî Vitamin C prevents Scurvy", fontsize=12)
plt.show()
